# 4-bit-Overlapping-Pattern-Detector-using-FSM-Digital-Design
# Description: 
Developed a digital design using Finite State Machine (FSM) that checks for the presence of a 4-bit overlapping pattern in a given sequence of bits. The design was implemented using Verilog hardware description language and simulated using a software tool.

- Designed the state diagram for the FSM
- Implemented the FSM using Verilog HDL
- Simulated the design using a software tool
- Analyzed the simulation results to verify the correctness of the design
- Optimized the design for better performance

# Outcome:
The 4-bit Overlapping Pattern Detector using FSM Digital Design was successfully implemented and tested. The design can be used in various applications where the detection of a specific pattern is required.

This project demonstrates your skills in digital design, Verilog HDL, and FSMs, and highlights your ability to analyze and optimize digital circuits. Adding this project to your CV will showcase your technical abilities and experience to potential employers.
