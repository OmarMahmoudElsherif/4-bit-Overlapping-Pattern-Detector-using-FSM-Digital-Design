# 4-bit-Overlapping-Pattern-Detector-using-FSM-Digital-Design
 -Description: 
Developed a digital design using Finite State Machine (FSM) that checks for the presence of a 4-bit overlapping pattern in a given sequence of bits. The design was implemented using Verilog hardware description language and simulated using a software tool.

 -Designed the state diagram for the FSM
 -Implemented the FSM using Verilog HDL
 -Simulated the design using a software tool
 -Analyzed the simulation results to verify the correctness of the design
 -Optimized the design for better performance
